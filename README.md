# 🧠 GAN-Based Comparative Study: DCGAN vs Conditional GAN in Low-Resource Settings

This project presents a comprehensive **comparative analysis** between **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)** and **Conditional GAN** architectures under low-resource settings. Using extensive visualizations and performance metrics, it emphasizes how **Conditional GANs outperform traditional DCGANs**, particularly for synthetic data generation relevant to **healthcare applications**.
